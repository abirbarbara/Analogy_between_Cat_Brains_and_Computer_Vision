# Analogy_between_Cat_Brains_and_Computer_Vision
Hubel and Wiesel found neurons respond to different stimuli. Similarly, CNN neurons are sensitive to various image features. Examining the first layer of CNNs mirrors studying early visual areas in the brain. This parallel demonstrates how machine learning can model neuroscience principles, connecting biological and artificial neural networks.
## Project Overview
This project simulates aspects of the visual cortex using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), inspired by the work of David Hunter Hubel and Torsten Wiesel. It demonstrates how CNNs, similar to biological brains, develop specialized neurons that respond to specific patterns in particular areas of the visual field.

## Key Features
- CNN model trained on images to simulate a basic "cat brain"
- Extraction of the first layer to create a "cortex" model
- Analysis of neuron activations to find the most excitable neurons
- Visualization of receptive fields and exciting patterns for top neurons
