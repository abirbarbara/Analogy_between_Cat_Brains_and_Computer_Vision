Hubel and Wiesel found neurons respond to different stimuli. Similarly, CNN neurons are sensitive to various image features. Examining the first layer of CNNs mirrors studying early visual areas in the brain. This parallel demonstrates how machine learning can model neuroscience principles, connecting biological and artificial neural networks.
